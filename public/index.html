            <h3>Chef Ronald Nguyen</h3>
        </div>
            <div class ="p2">
                <p>Mr. Nguyen is considered the heart and soul of Cafe Cougar, his vision to create a cafeteria at the University of 
            Houston Sugarland Campus offering healthy, affordable and delicious meals came to life in February of 2024. Since then
            he has had the privilege of being head chef and overseer of operations.
            He is an expert in diverse cuisine from all over the world and 
            has even participated in various cooking workshops, learning a great deal from other famous chefs.
            This has allowed him to incorporate his knowledge into the kitchen at Cafe Cougar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Born in Houston Texas, Mr. Nguyen grew up in a Vietnamese household. His father, who he quotes as his biggest
                    inspiration in cooking, taught him everything he needed to know to cook at home. As he grew older he decided to take
                    his love of cooking to the next level, enrolling in the Culinary Institute in America. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Mr. Nguyen is not busy working at Cafe Cougar, he enjoys spending time with his wife and children. His favorite hobbies include
                    travelling the world, birdwatching, and listening to classical music.
